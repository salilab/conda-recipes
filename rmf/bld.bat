:: We use Anaconda's build of boost 1.60, which includes
:: zlib support, but defining BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK (below) makes boost try to
:: link against boost_zlib*.lib, which doesn't exist. Override this by

:: one, link against kernel32 instead (which pretty much everything links
:: against, so this doesn't introduce an extra dependency)
