The `linux-64` directory contains files to set up Docker images that
can be used to build conda packages for 64-bit Linux. To build a Docker
image, use:

    podman build -t conda linux-64
    podman build -t miniforge miniforge
    podman build -t mambaforge mambaforge

The `mac-setup.sh` script sets up a minimal conda environment on a Mac,
running OS X 10.10 in a VirtualBox image (10.10 is the oldest version supported
by Anaconda). It assumes the Mac has Homebrew installed, and so hides the
Homebrew packages to avoid contaminating the conda build environment.

The `linux-32` directory contains the commands we run to set up a `mock`
chroot that can be used to build conda packages for 32-bit Linux.

The Windows packages are built in a Windows 7 VM with Visual Studio Express
installed. Different versions of Visual Studio are needed to build different
packages:

 - Any package depending on Python 2.7 needs to be built with Visual Studio
   2008, and will have the `vc9` feature set.

 - Any package with no Python dependency is currently built with Visual
   Studio 2010 and has no `vc*` feature set. To reproduce this environment,
   download [MSVS 2010](http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/E/5/1E5F1C0A-0D5B-426A-A603-1798B951DDAE/VS2010Express1.iso)
   then install and register it (get a license key from Microsoft). Then just
   use the provided Start menu item to get an environment for building 32-bit
   packages. For 64-bit, next download the [x64 SDK ISO](http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/1/0/F10113F5-B750-4969-A255-274341AC6BCE/GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso)
   and install that. Then apply the MSVS 2010 SP1 update. This breaks the SDK,
   so finally fix that by applying [KB2519277](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2519277).
   To get an environment suitable for building the packages, run
   `setenv /xp /x64 /release`.

 - Any package depending on Python 3.5 or 3.6 needs to be built with
   Visual Studio 2015, and will have the `vc14` feature set.

 - [Microsoft MPI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831.aspx)
   should be installed on each machine (there are two installer packages
   at that website, both of which need to be installed). No further setup
   should be necessary, since cmake detects MS MPI automatically.
