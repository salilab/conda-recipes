  summary: "HDF5 pinned at 1.10.6, for use with Modeller"
  description: >
    [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) is a data model, library, and file
    format for storing and managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of
    datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high
    volume and complex data. HDF5 is portable and is extensible, allowing
    applications to evolve in their use of HDF5. The HDF5 Technology suite
    includes tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing,
    and analyzing data in the HDF5 format.

    There is already an HDF5 conda package; however, Modeller is built against
    a specific version of HDF5 (and since Modeller is not open source, we
    cannot recompile it). Rather than force everybody that wants to use
    Modeller (and other packages that build on top of Modeller, such as MDT)
    to downgrade their copy of HDF5, we provide a copy of the library pinned
    at the version needed by Modeller. It installs in a non-standard location
    so it won't conflict with the main HDF5 package.

    If you have problems with this conda package, please
    [open an issue](https://github.com/salilab/conda-recipes/issues).
